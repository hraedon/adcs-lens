"""Drift detection over two read-only snapshots (Stance 2).

Pure, stdlib-only. Diffs the *findings* run_all produces for an older and a newer
export and reports what changed: regressions (new findings), fixes (resolved
findings), and severity changes on the same issue. This is the air-gap-preserving
"what got worse since the last scan" signal — no live access, just two exports.

A finding's drift identity is ``(check, subject, source)`` — the same check on
the same object, disambiguated by the source fact so that multiple findings
sharing a subject (e.g. two CRLs from one issuer, two certs with the same
subject) are not silently collapsed. A severity change on that tuple is a
"changed" finding, not a new-and-resolved pair. Content changes (different
title, detail) with an unchanged severity are also reported as "changed" but
do not count as regressions.
