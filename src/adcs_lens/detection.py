    vector where ESC9 previously fired on every template carrying the flag).

    This mirrors the false-negative-safe subset of ESC1's gating (enroll ACL +
    no manager approval) — these gates can only suppress templates that are not
    attacker-reachable, so they cannot hide a real ESC9 primitive. It does NOT
    gate on client-auth EKU or on DC binding enforcement: the EKU gate has
    mapping-relevance edge cases (the remaining open question in WI-038), and
    enforcement gating would need opt-in DC data whose absence would suppress
    ESC9 on most exports (ESC16, the CA-level analogue, likewise hedges on
    enforcement in its detail text rather than gating).

    Degrades honestly: when template security descriptors were not collected the
    enroll ACL cannot be evaluated, so this returns nothing and ESC1 emits the

    The ACL-gated detectors (ESC1–ESC5, ESC7, ESC9, ESC13, ESC15) reason about the ACE
    trustee SID directly, with two honesty boundaries:

    * **No group-token expansion.** Nested-group membership is not modeled: a Deny
      on a group containing the requester, or Enroll/control rights held only
      transitively via group membership, are invisible. The *absence* of an ACL
      finding is therefore not by itself proof that no ACL path exists.
    * **Allowlist trustee classification.** A trustee is treated as privileged
      only when its SID is in the curated high-privilege set (built-in admin and
      operator groups, SYSTEM/service identities, domain trust accounts, and the
      well-known admin RIDs); everything else — including custom groups and
      named accounts — is treated as low-privilege. This fails toward flagging:
      a custom *privileged* group may produce a finding that is really noise.

    This note surfaces both boundaries in the output (not only in source
    comments) whenever ACL reasoning actually ran, so a reader never over-trusts
    an ACL result in either direction.
