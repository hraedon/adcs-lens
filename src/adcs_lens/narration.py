"""Optional narration layer — executive summary from findings.

Imports the deterministic core (detection + consequences) and produces a
plain-language executive summary. The default mode is deterministic (no AI);
an optional AI-enhanced mode uses an LLM to refine the narrative, falling
back to the deterministic summary when the LLM client is unavailable.

This module is OPTIONAL — the detection core never imports it; it imports the
core, never the reverse (enforced by the architecture test: no core module may
import narration, and the CLI may reach it only lazily, inside a function).
