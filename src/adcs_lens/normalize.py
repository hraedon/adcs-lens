# Well-known SIDs that name a principal whose compromise is already
# domain-compromise-class (or the machine/service accounts that hold the keys
# anyway). A privileged right (enroll, write, ManageCA) granted to one of these
# is NOT an escalation finding — the trustee already has equivalent or greater
# power. Anything *outside* this set is treated as low-privilege.
#
# The classification is deliberately an allowlist of high-privilege SIDs rather
# than a blocklist of broad/low-privilege ones: the earlier blocklist missed
# custom groups entirely (e.g. Enroll granted to a purpose-built "Help Desk"
# group silently produced no ESC1 finding — a domain-compromise-class false
# negative, confirmed against the pre-inversion code). Failing toward flagging
# is the right direction for a defensive tool: a custom *privileged* group may
# read as a finding (noise), but no low-privilege trustee is ever silently
# invisible. Surfaced as the ACL_GROUP_TOKEN_CAVEAT estate note.
