"""Normalized data model — the contract every detector depends on.

These dataclasses are the boundary between the collector's on-disk JSON/DER
export and the deterministic detectors. They are frozen and use immutable
collection types (``tuple``/``frozenset``) so a parsed :class:`Estate` cannot be
mutated out from under a detector. Every field maps to a named collector output
(see ``plans/001`` Phase 1 and the threat model's data-source columns).

Cert/CRL lifecycle fields are populated only when the optional ``[certs]`` extra
is installed; otherwise they are ``None`` and lifecycle checks degrade to a note
(:attr:`Manifest.certs_parsed` records which happened).
