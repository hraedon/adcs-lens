# AD CS threat model & detectability boundary

This is the design spine of adcs-lens. It catalogues the AD CS weakness classes
the tool reasons about and — critically — classifies each by **what a read-only
configuration export can actually detect statically**, versus what would require
active probing the tool will never do.

The detectability column *is* the "flag, don't probe" principle made concrete:

- **Static** — the enabling condition is fully readable from exported
  configuration. adcs-lens detects it deterministically.
- **Static (enabling config)** — the *prerequisite* is readable, but confirming
  exploitability requires runtime conditions (e.g. an NTLM relay, an RPC call).
  adcs-lens flags the prerequisite and says so; it never confirms by probing.
- **Out** — detection inherently requires authenticating, enrolling, relaying,
  or otherwise acting against live AD CS. Explicitly out of scope.
- **Out (unresolved)** — no statically-detectable enabling configuration has
  been identified in canonical tooling (e.g. Certipy's enumeration engine) or
  published research. The ESC number is preserved for catalogue continuity but
  the class is not classified. Not silently omitted — every ESC number in the
  catalogue is accounted for, enforced by the traceability test.
- **Static (not yet implemented)** — the enabling condition is statically
  readable, but no detector is built yet (and the collector may not capture the
  field). Listed so the catalogue stays honest rather than silently omitting a
  detectable class; tracked as a work item.

## ESC catalogue

| ID | What it is | Detectability | Primary data source |
|----|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| ESC1 | Template allows requester-supplied SAN + client-auth EKU, enrollable by low-priv | **Static** | template `msPKI-Certificate-Name-Flag` (ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT), EKU list, enroll ACL |
| ESC2 | Template with Any-Purpose EKU or no EKU (SubCA-equivalent) | **Static** | template `pKIExtendedKeyUsage` / EKU absence |
| ESC3 | Enrollment-Agent (Certificate Request Agent) EKU usable by low-priv | **Static** | template EKU + enroll ACL |
| ESC4 | Template object ACL grants write to low-priv, or low-priv owner (can be edited into ESC1) | **Static** | template `nTSecurityDescriptor` (DACL + owner) |
| ESC5 | Writable ACL / low-priv owner on PKI objects (CA objects, NTAuth, PKS containers) | **Static** | container/object `nTSecurityDescriptor` (DACL + owner) |
| ESC6 | `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2` set on the CA | **Static** | CA registry `policy\EditFlags` (`certutil -getreg`) |
| ESC7 | CA permissions (ManageCA / ManageCertificates) held by low-priv, or low-priv owner of the CA security descriptor | **Static** | CA security descriptor DACL + owner (`certutil -getreg CA\Security`) |
| ESC8 | NTLM relay to HTTP/RPC enrollment (Web Enrollment / CES) | **Static (enabling config)** — detect role installed + EPA off; relay itself is **Out** | role/endpoint inventory; IIS EPA setting |
| ESC9 | `CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION` on a template enrollable by low-priv without manager approval (weak mapping) | **Static** | template `msPKI-Enrollment-Flag` + enroll ACL |
| ESC10 | Weak certificate mappings on DCs (`StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement` / `CertificateMappingMethods`) | **Static** (needs DC registry in export) | DC registry export |
| ESC11 | `IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST` off → RPC (ICertPassage) relay | **Static (enabling config)** — flag the flag; relay is **Out** | CA registry `InterfaceFlags` (`certutil -getreg`) |
| ESC12 | *Unresolved* — no statically-detectable enabling configuration has been identified in canonical tooling or published research; the ESC number is preserved for continuity. Tracked as WI-026. | **Out (unresolved)** | n/a |
| ESC13 | Issuance-policy OID linked to a privileged group | **Static** | template `msPKI-Certificate-Policy` + `msDS-OIDToGroupLink` on the OID object |
| ESC14 | Weak explicit cert mapping via `altSecurityIdentities` | **Static** (needs AD object read in export) | AD principal `altSecurityIdentities` |
| ESC15 | EKUwu (CVE-2024-49019): v1 template + application policies in request | **Static (enabling config)** — flag vulnerable v1 templates; severity tracks CA patch state (HIGH unpatched / MEDIUM unknown / suppressed patched); request-side is **Out** | template schema version + name flags; CA patch state |
| ESC16 | CA-wide disable of the security extension (`disabled_extensions` contains `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2`) — the CA-level analogue of ESC9 | **Static** | CA `disabled_extensions` (policy `DisableExtensionList`) |

## Non-ESC hygiene & lifecycle

These are the checks that matter most to a legacy shop on an audit clock and are
under-served by the offensive tooling entirely:

| Check | What it catches | Detectability | Source |
|-------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| CA cert expiry | Root/sub-CA certificate approaching/past expiry | **Static** | CA cert in export |
| CRL signing expiry | The CRL signing cert expiring — silent estate-wide auth failure | **Static** | CA config / CRL |
| CRL freshness | Published CRL stale or overdue vs. its validity period | **Static** | exported CRL + config |
| CDP / AIA reachability | Distribution points declared but unreachable/misconfigured | **Static (declared)** — config only; no live fetch | CA config |
| OCSP URL presence | CA certificate lacks an OCSP responder URL in AIA | **Static** | CA cert AIA extension |
| Weak signing algorithm | CA signing with SHA-1 / MD5 | **Static** | CA cert / config |
| Weak key length | CA or template minimum key size below policy (RSA baseline; ECDSA templates skipped) | **Static** | CA cert; template `msPKI-Minimal-Key-Size` + CSP |
| Audit configuration | CA auditing disabled or under-scoped | **Static** | CA registry `AuditFilter` |
| Orphaned / unused templates | Published templates nobody should still enroll | **Static** | published-templates list vs. template inventory |

## Implications for the data model & collector

The detectability table dictates what the read-only collector must capture, and
nothing more:

1. **CA registry configuration** — `certutil -getreg` (CA, policy, and security
   hives): `EditFlags`, `InterfaceFlags`, `AuditFilter`, role security.
2. **AD Public Key Services container** (Configuration NC): `pKICertificateTemplate`
   objects with all `msPKI-*` attributes and EKUs; Certification Authorities;
   Enrollment Services; NTAuthCertificates; OID objects (for ESC13). Each with
   its `nTSecurityDescriptor`.
3. **Certificates & CRLs**: CA/sub-CA certs and the current CRL(s) for lifecycle
   and algorithm/key checks.
4. **Role/endpoint inventory**: which AD CS roles are installed (Web Enrollment,
   CES/CEP) for the ESC8 *enabling-config* flag.
5. **(Optional, for ESC10/ESC14)** targeted DC registry values and principal
   `altSecurityIdentities` — gated, because they widen the export footprint.

Everything above is obtainable read-only with `certutil`, the AD CS PowerShell
module, and LDAP reads against the Configuration NC. No item requires
authenticating *as* an enrollee or issuing a request — which is exactly why the
tool can stay defensive.
