# AGENTS.md

Conventions and quick reference for agents (and humans) working on adcs-lens.

## What this is

Local-first, **read-only** AD CS / PKI posture analysis. The tool ingests
*copies* of a CA + PKI configuration export and answers questions about its
hygiene, misconfiguration (the ESC classes), and infrastructure certificate
lifecycle. It never authenticates to, enrolls against, or writes to live AD CS.
The deterministic core has **no AI in the truth path** — the LLM layer only
narrates facts the core computed. See `README.md` for the full charter.

## Orient

1. **Read the threat model.** `docs/threat-model.md` — the ESC + hygiene
   catalogue with the static-detectability boundary. This is the design spine:
   it dictates what the collector captures and what the tool is allowed to claim.
2. **Read the model** (once it exists). The normalized data model + the
   dataclasses will be the concrete contract, mapped against a real export.
3. **Validate against reality.** Tests encode measured numbers from a real,
   gitignored export; synthetic fixtures cover the structural cases for CI.

## Hard rules

- **Read-only, never live.** No code authenticates to, enrolls against, or
  writes to AD CS. Input is exported files only. **No standing connection and no
  alerting** — change detection comes from diffing scheduled read-only exports
  (Stance 2, the `diff` command), not monitoring. Live/continuous concerns are
  cert-watch's (see Boundary).
- **Flag, don't probe.** Detect the *enabling configuration* of a weakness
  statically; never perform the attack (enroll, relay, request) to confirm it.
  An ESC8/ESC11/ESC15 finding reports the prerequisite and says exploitability
  is not confirmed. This is the line between adcs-lens and offensive tooling.
- **No AI in the deterministic core.** Detection and lifecycle checks run with
  zero model calls. Narration is an optional layer that imports the core, never
  the reverse (enforce with an architecture test).
- **Defensive output only.** Findings are framed for remediation and evidence,
  not exploitation. No payloads, no relay tooling, no request crafting.
- **No work-domain identifiers in committed files.** Docs, reflections, and
  fixtures use placeholders (e.g. `WORK-DOMAIN.local`, `LABCA`). Real exports
  live in a gitignored `samples/` and must never be committed.
- **Fixture data is synthetic.** No real CA names, template names, OIDs, SIDs,
  or domain names in committed test files.
- **Stdlib-only core.** Keep the truth path dependency-free
  (`json`, `sqlite3`, `argparse`, stdlib parsing) so it stays portable and
  air-gappable. Narration / web are optional extras.

## Build / test / lint (intended — mirrors the sibling projects)

```bash
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/pytest -q            # unit + fixture tests
.venv/bin/ruff check .
.venv/bin/mypy src
```

## Collector

`scripts/Export-AdcsEstate.ps1` (to be built) produces the inputs: read-only
PowerShell run on the CA / a tier-0 admin box, using `certutil -getreg`, the AD
CS PowerShell module, and LDAP reads against the Configuration NC. See the
"Implications for the data model & collector" section of `docs/threat-model.md`
for exactly what it must capture — and what it must not (no enrollment, no
request).

## Boundary with cert-watch

The dividing principle is **access, not subject**: anything answerable from a
**read-only export** (point-in-time or diffed over time) is adcs-lens; anything
needing **standing live access or push alerting** is cert-watch. So
infrastructure cert/CRL *expiry as of an export* is an adcs-lens finding, but
*continuous* CRL freshness for private-trust certs is cert-watch's default scan
workflow (cert-watch WI-042). The two compose — adcs-lens discovers PKI
structure (incl. CAs with no serving leaf), cert-watch watches the live
deadlines. Drift detection in adcs-lens comes from diffing scheduled read-only
exports (WI-001), never from a standing connection.

## Status

**PARKED at v1.1.0 (2026-07-15) — feature-complete for the charter; no active
development planned.** The repo is public, released, and CI-gated (including a
monthly scheduled run as a rot canary). Re-entry starts here: the open work
items in the work-item store (WI-042 structured `Finding` metadata for the
SARIF SID, WI-043 `_finding_with_consequence` dedup) are the parked backlog;
`docs/review-findings.md` holds older deferred findings. If the scheduled CI
run has gone red since the park date, fix CI first — it is dependency/runner
rot, not a regression in the code.

The deterministic core is built and tested (ingest → `doctor` → `diff`, ESC1–ESC11,
ESC13–ESC16 detectors — ESC12 has no static-detectability boundary — plus
crypto/operational hygiene detectors `WEAK_SIG_ALG` / `WEAK_KEY_SIZE` /
`WEAK_TEMPLATE_KEY_SIZE` / `CA_AUDIT_DISABLED` / `CA_AUDIT_UNDERSCOPED`, infra
cert/CRL lifecycle, and an architecture guard), plus a per-template unreadable-DACL
signal (`TEMPLATE_ACL_UNREADABLE`). The read-only PowerShell collector
(`scripts/Export-AdcsEstate.ps1`) captures CA config, templates (with their
DACLs → ACEs, and an `acl_obtained` marker), CA role security
(`CA\Security` → ESC7, incl. `owner_sid` for owner-based control), PKI-object ACLs
(NTAuth / AIA / CDP / PKS containers + CA objects → ESC5), IIS enrollment
endpoints (Web Enrollment / CES bindings + Windows-auth + Extended Protection
→ ESC8), issuance OIDs, and the opt-in ESC10/ESC14 DC certificate-mapping passes
(`-CollectDcMapping`: `esc14-altsecid` LDAP read of principal
altSecurityIdentities + `esc10-dc-registry` per-DC KDC
StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement and Schannel CertificateMappingMethods via
WMI StdRegProv with explicit creds); its **core passes are validated
end-to-end against a live enterprise CA** (LABCA, `WORK-DOMAIN.local`), and the
v0.6.1 collector's `owner_sid` capture (CA + template + PKI-object) is
**live-validated** — the CA owner is BUILTIN\Administrators (high-priv), so
ESC7 owner-based control correctly does not fire. The v0.6.1 fix corrects an
LDAP `SecurityMasks` bug that left template/PKI-object owner_sids empty in
v0.6.0; the core degrades honestly either way.
ESC15 (EKUwu / CVE-2024-49019) flags schema v1 templates a low-priv
principal can enroll in, with severity tracking CA patch state (HIGH unpatched /
MEDIUM unknown / suppressed patched) — the collector emits `ca_patch_state`
(unknown by default; a future enhancement can populate it from the OS build).
The statically-detectable ESC family is now built (ESC1–ESC11, ESC13–ESC16;
ESC12 has no established static-detectability boundary — see
`docs/threat-model.md`, tracked as WI-026).
Phase-1 honesty/precision work closes the false-positive and false-negative
edges: ESC7 expands broad rights (GenericAll/FullControl) via the `_COVERS`
implication map so blanket CA control is not missed, and models **owner-based
control** of `CA\Security` (a low-priv owner can rewrite the DACL → ManageCA);
ESC9 is gated on low-priv enrollability + no manager approval (mirroring ESC1's
FN-safe subset) so it no longer fires on non-enrollable / approval-required
templates; the template weak-key detector is algorithm-aware (ECDSA templates
skipped via CSP or unambiguous EC curve sizes 256/384/521); ESC4/ESC5 model
owner-based control (a low-priv owner can rewrite the DACL); and ESC8
distinguishes EPA allow/none/unknown in the finding detail. The collector
(v0.6.0) now emits template `csp` + `owner_sid`, PKI-object `owner_sid`, CA
`owner_sid` + `ca_patch_state`, and decodes GENERIC_ALL on CA security. The core
warns (stderr, not fail) when a collector predates the minimum it expects
(`MIN_COLLECTOR_VERSION`), and surfaces the ACL group-token-expansion caveat as
an estate-level coverage note.
ESC5 is
negative-validated on the real CA with positive validation via the synthetic
fixture; ESC8/ESC10/ESC11/ESC13/ESC14 are **positive-validated on the real lab**
(ESC8 live `/certsrv` HTTP+NTLM+no-EPA → HIGH; ESC10 via a temporary Schannel UPN
bit + disabled binding on a DC; ESC11 via a temporarily-cleared
IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST; ESC13 via a temporary AMA OID→universal-security-group
link on a v1 template; ESC14 via a temporary weak altSecurityIdentities — all
reverted with cleanup discipline). The ESC13 validation caught a collector bug: it
read the OID→group link from the non-existent `msPKI-OIDToGroupLink` instead of
`msDS-OIDToGroupLink` (a group DN), so ESC13 was a permanent false negative.

The **value-delivery layer** is now built on top of the detection core:
crypto/operational hygiene detectors (`WEAK_SIG_ALG`, `WEAK_KEY_SIZE` /
`WEAK_TEMPLATE_KEY_SIZE`, `CA_AUDIT_DISABLED` / `CA_AUDIT_UNDERSCOPED`) consume
already-captured fields; a plain-language **consequences catalogue**
(`consequences.py`, pure data — no AI) attaches a summary / risk / remediation
block to every finding in the text and JSON output (envelope `schema_version`
bumped to 2); `doctor --sarif` emits SARIF v2.1.0 for CI / GRC integration,
`doctor --html` emits a self-contained deterministic HTML evidence report; and
a threat-model ↔ detector **traceability test** (`test_threat_model_traceability`)
locks the design spine so no ESC class or hygiene row can drift undetected.

The collector's OS-independent helpers (bit decoders, certutil parsers, IIS
classifiers) are unit-tested with Pester via `-FunctionsOnly` (CI `collector-helpers`
job on pwsh); the Windows-only collection paths stay out of scope (WI-009).
